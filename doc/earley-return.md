# Early return pattern in JavaScript

> The Early Return pattern **is a coding technique** where a function or method is stopped as soon as a specific condition is met and evaluates to `true`. Instead of proceeding with the rest of the function's logic, the method immediately returns a value or performs an action based on the condition's outcome.

**This pattern avoids unnecessary nesting of code** and helps streamline the flow of execution, leading to more readable and concise code.

## Benefits of the Early Return Pattern

- Early Return simplifies code structure and improves readability by reducing nested conditionals. 
- Each return statement conveys the outcome explicitly, making the code self-explanatory.
- Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity: Cyclomatic complexity refers to the number of independent paths within a function
- Early returns help lower the cyclomatic complexity by minimizing the number of decision points, resulting in code that is easier to test and maintain.
- Early Return pattern enhances debugging and refactoring by isolating and facilitating the examination of return statements for pinpointing issues during development. 
- Additionally, refactoring becomes more manageable as individual sections can be modified without impacting other parts of the method.
