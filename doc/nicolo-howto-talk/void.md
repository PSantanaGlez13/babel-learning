# void operator in JavaScript

In JavaScript, `void` is a unary operator that evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`. It is primarily used to ensure that an expression evaluates to `undefined` regardless of the original value or side effects of the expression.

## Syntax

```javascript
void expression
```

## Common Uses of `void`

1. **Ensuring `undefined` Return Value**:
   Using `void` can be useful in contexts where you need an expression to explicitly return `undefined`. For example:

   ```javascript
   undefined = 3;
   void 0; // returns undefined
   void (0); // returns undefined
   void "hello"; // returns undefined
   ```

2. **Bookmarklets**:
   In JavaScript bookmarklets (small JavaScript programs stored as a URL), using `void` can prevent the browser from navigating to a new URL when the code is executed. Try this in your browser's address bar:

   ```javascript
   javascript:void(alert('Hello, World!'));
   ```

3. **Self-invoking Functions**:
   `void` can be used with self-invoking functions (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs) to ensure they return `undefined`:

   ```javascript
    > void (function() { return 1; })()
    undefined
    > (function() { return 1; })()
    1
   ```

4. **Avoiding JavaScript Engine Optimization Issues**:
   In rare cases, `void` is used to prevent JavaScript engines from applying certain optimizations that could cause unexpected behavior, although this is more of a historical artifact and not common practice today.
