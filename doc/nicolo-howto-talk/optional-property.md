# Understanding the `optional` Property in a Babel AST `OptionalMemberExpression` Node

In a Babel Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), the `OptionalMemberExpression` node represents an optional chaining operation involving member access. This node is used to describe expressions where you use optional chaining to safely access deeply nested properties of an object without having to explicitly check if each reference in the chain is non-null or undefined.

The `optional` property in an `OptionalMemberExpression` node is a boolean that indicates whether the member access is optional. 
- If `optional` is `true`, it means the member access is part of an optional chain, where the operation will short-circuit if the preceding part of the chain is *nullish* (`null` or `undefined`). 
- If `optional` is `false`, it means the member access is not optional, and any attempt to access a member on a nullish value will result in an error.

### Example

Consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
const obj = {
  foo: {
    bar: 42,
  },
};

const value = obj?.foo?.bar;
```

In this example, `obj?.foo?.bar` uses optional chaining to safely access `bar` without causing an error if `obj` or `obj.foo` is nullish.

The Babel AST representation of this optional chaining operation will include `OptionalMemberExpression` nodes. Here's a simplified view of how Babel might represent it:

```json
{
  "type": "OptionalMemberExpression",
  "object": {
    "type": "OptionalMemberExpression",
    "object": {
      "type": "Identifier",
      "name": "obj"
    },
    "property": {
      "type": "Identifier",
      "name": "foo"
    },
    "optional": true
  },
  "property": {
    "type": "Identifier",
    "name": "bar"
  },
  "optional": true
}
```

### Explanation of the `optional` Property

- **Outer `OptionalMemberExpression`**: Represents the access to `bar` (`obj?.foo?.bar`). The `optional` property is `true`, indicating that if `obj?.foo` is nullish, the access will return `undefined` instead of causing an error.
  
- **Inner `OptionalMemberExpression`**: Represents the access to `foo` (`obj?.foo`). The `optional` property is also `true`, indicating that if `obj` is nullish, the access will return `undefined` instead of causing an error.

For instance, for the expression `obj?.foo.bar` the outer `optional` property would be `false` and the inner `optional` property would be `true`. See [/doc/nicolo-howto-talk/production-example/optional-chain.md](/doc/nicolo-howto-talk/production-example/optional-chain.md) for the corresponding AST.


If the `optional` property were `false` in any of these nodes, it would mean that the member access at that level is not using optional chaining, and an attempt to access a property on a nullish value would throw an error.

### Summary

In an `OptionalMemberExpression` node in a Babel AST, the `optional` property plays a crucial role in determining whether the member access operation is part of an optional chain. This property allows Babel to correctly parse and transform JavaScript code that uses optional chaining, ensuring that the semantics of the original code are preserved during the transformation process.
